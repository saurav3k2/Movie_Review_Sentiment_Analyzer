        "\n",
        "**Problem Statement:** It is difficult to manually read and classify hundreds of movie reviews as positive or negative. An automated solution is required to process the reviews and determine their sentiment with speed and consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question:** How can we develop a machine learning model that classifies a movie review as positive or negative based on its text?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:** This project builds a text classification model that uses Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze movie reviews and predict whether they express a positive or negative sentiment. The model is trained on labeled reviews using TF-IDF and logistic regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Components\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Loading:** Load dataset containing movie reviews and sentiment labels\n",
        "2. **Text Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess text (remove punctuation, lowercase, stopwords)\n",
        "3. **Feature Extraction:** Convert text into numeric format using TF-IDF vectorization\n",
        "4. **Model Training:** Split dataset and train logistic regression model\n",
        "5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1 score\n",
        "6. **Prediction System:** Allow prediction of sentiment from new reviews\n",
